<p>A group of programmers and marketers were traveling to a trade
show on a train. Each of the marketers had bought a ticket, but the
programmers had only bought one ticket for the lot of them.</p>
<p>One of the programmers was keeping a lookout, and when the
conductor neared their car he called out "The conductor's coming!"
and all of the programmers piled into the train's lavatory and
closed the door. The conductor took the tickets of all of the
marketers, and then knocked on the lavatory door and called "Ticket
please." The programmers slid their ticket under the door, and the
conductor took it and left.</p>
<p>The programmers were laughing at the marketers for the rest of
the trip, and the marketers felt like idiots.</p>
<p>On the way back, the marketers decided they would use the same
trick and only bought one ticket for them. But this time, the
programmers didn't buy a single ticket! Again, one of the
programmers kept a lookout for the conductor. When he called
"Conductor coming!" all of the programmers piled into one lavatory,
and all of the marketers shut themselves into another lavatory.</p>
<p>One programmer came back out of his lavatory, knocked on the
other door, and said "Ticket please!"</p>

<p>Three programmers meet accidentally at the urinal while
attending a technical conference. The first programmer finishes up
his business, washes his hands with loads of water, walks over to
the towels and uses almost the entire roll to dry his hands. He
turns to the other two and says "At Microsoft, we are trained to be
extremely thorough."</p>
<p>The second programmer finishes up, walks over to the sink and
washes his hands with much less water, then uses a single towel to
dry his hands. He remarks to the other two "At IBM, we are trained
not only to be very thorough, but also very efficient."</p>
<p>The third programmer finishes his business, walks right past the
sink and towel rack and lauds over his shoulder as he walks out the
door: "At Apple we don't piss on our hands!"</p>

<p>A year ago I upgraded from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0 and I have
observed that this new program started an unexpected subroutine
called Son, which occupies almost all my space and important
resources. Also, Wife 1.0 auto-installs as a host in all my
programs and auto-starts every time I want to use any of them. Apps
like Beers With Friends 10.3 and Sunday Football 5.0 no longer
work.</p>
<p>Every now and then, a spyware program called In-Law 1.0 starts
and freezes Wife 1.0. I haven't been able to uninstall this spyware
and I cannot minimize Wife 1.0 if I want to run any of my favorite
apps. I'm thinking about downgrading to Girlfriend 7.0 but
uninstall IS NOT WORKING!!! Please Help!!</p>
<p>SUPPORT RESPONSE:</p>
<p>Dear User:</p>
<p>This is a known bug submitted by users. In most cases the source
is pretty simple. Many users go from version Girlfriend X.0 to Wife
1.0 thinking Wife 1.0 is an utilities and entertainment app.
However, Wife 1.0 is designed to control the system entirely. It is
very unlikely that you'll be able to uninstall Wife 1.0 and return
to any version of Girlfriend. There are hidden files on Girlfriend
X.0 that will make it work just like Wife 1.0.</p>
<p>Some users have tried clean formatting their systems in order to
install Girlfriend Plus 1.0 or Wife 2.0 but ended with bigger
problems afterwards. Please refer to the warning section on the
read-me file, specifically the alimony chapter.</p>
<p>Also, if you update to Girlfriend 8.0, do not update to Wife 2.0
because problems will be worst, expensive and not recommended for
normal users. Frequently used upgrades include Celibacy 1.0 or
Gay/Lesbian 5.3.</p>
<p>I personally have Wife 1.0 installed and suggest you explore the
manual in its entirety. The user agreement states that the user
shall be responsible for any problem, no matter the cause. A really
powerful command, which normally un-freezes the application can be
found under C:/IMSORRY.EXE. Having said that, Wife 1.0 is really
interesting but has very expensive updates. Recommended plugins
include Flowers 12.0, Jewels 2.3 and Vacations 2.3. Yeshoney 9.0
and Whateveryousay 12.3 are also very popular.</p>
<p>Finally, Wife 1.0 is not compatible with MiniSkirtSecretary 3.3.
Installing it can cause irreversible damage to the operating
system.</p>

<p>A computer science student is studying under a tree and another
pulls up on a flashy new bike. The first student asks, "Where'd you
get that?"</p>
<p>The student on the bike replies, "While I was studying outside,
a beautiful girl pulled up on her bike. She took off all her
clothes and said, 'You can have anything you want'."</p>
<p>The first student responds, "Good choice! Her clothes probably
wouldn't have fit you."</p>

<p>A Geologist and an engineer are sitting next to each other on a
long flight from LA to NY. The Geologist leans over to the Engineer
and asks if he would like to play a fun game. The Engineer just
wants to take a nap, so he politely declines and rolls over to the
window to catch a few winks. The Geologist persists and explains
that the game is real easy and a lotta fun. He explains, "I ask you
a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5. Then
you ask me a question, and if I don't know the answer, I'll pay you
$5." Again, the Engineer politely declines and tries to get to
sleep. The Geologist now somewhat agitated, says, "OK, if you don't
know the answer you pay me $5, and if I don't know the answer, I'll
pay you $50!"</p>
<p>This catches the Engineer's attention, and he sees no end to
this torment unless he plays, so he agrees to the game. The
Geologist asks the first question. "What's the distance from the
Earth to the moon?"</p>
<p>The Engineer doesn't say a word, but reaches into his wallet,
pulls out a five dollar bill and hands it to the Geologist.</p>
<p>Now, it's the Engineer's turn. He asks the Geologist, "What goes
up a hill with three legs, and comes down on four?" The Geologist
looks up at him with a puzzled look. He takes out his laptop
computer and searches all of his references. He taps into the
Airphone with his modem and searches the net and the Library of
Congress. Frustrated, he sends e-mail to his co-workers -- all to
no avail.</p>
<p>After about an hour, he wakes the Engineer and hands him $50.
The Engineer politely takes the $50 and turns away to try to get
back to sleep.</p>
<p>The Geologist is more than a little miffed, shakes the Engineer
and asks, "Well, so what's the answer?"</p>
<p>Without a word, the Engineer reaches into his wallet, hands the
Geologist $5, and turns away to get back to sleep.</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a shepherd looking after his sheep on
the side of a deserted road. Suddenly a brand new Porsche screeches
to a halt. The driver, a man dressed in an Armani suit, Cerutti
shoes, Ray-Ban sunglasses, TAG-Heuer wrist-watch, and a Versace
tie, gets out and asks the Shepherd:</p>
<p>Man: "If I can tell you how many sheep you have, will you give
me one of them?"</p>
<p>The shepherd looks at the young man, and then looks at the large
flock of grazing sheep and replies:</p>
<p>Shepherd: "Okay."</p>
<p>The young man parks the car, connects his laptop to the
mobile-fax, enters a NASA Webster, scans the ground using his GPS,
opens a database and 60 Excel tables filled with logarithms and
pivot tables, then prints out a 150 page report on his high-tech
mini-printer. He turns to the shepherd and says,</p>
<p>Man: "You have exactly 1,586 sheep here."</p>
<p>The shepherd cheers,</p>
<p>Shepherd: "That's correct, you can have your sheep."</p>
<p>The young man makes his pick and puts it in the back of his
Porsche. The shepherd looks at him and asks,</p>
<p>Shepherd: "If I guess your profession, will you return my animal
to me?"</p>
<p>The young man answers;</p>
<p>Man: "Yes, why not?"</p>
<p>Shepherd: "You are an IT consultant."</p>
<p>Man: "How did you know?"</p>
<p>Shepherd: "Very simple. First, you came here without being
called. Second, you charged me a fee to tell me something I already
knew, and third, you don't understand anything about my business.
Now can I have my DOG back?"</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>C</strong> would be <strong>Judaism</strong> - it's old
and restrictive, but most of the world is familiar with its laws
and respects them. The catch is, you can't convert into it - you're
either into it from the start, or you will think that it's
insanity. Also, when things go wrong, many people are willing to
blame the problems of the world on it.</p>
<p><strong>Java</strong> would be <strong>Fundamentalist
Christianity</strong> - it's theoretically based on C, but it voids
so many of the old laws that it doesn't feel like the original at
all. Instead, it adds its own set of rigid rules, which its
followers believe to be far superior to the original. Not only are
they certain that it's the best language in the world, but they're
willing to burn those who disagree at the stake.</p>
<p><strong>PHP</strong> would be <strong>Cafeteria
Christianity</strong> - Fights with Java for the web market. It
draws a few concepts from C and Java, but only those that it really
likes. Maybe it's not as coherent as other languages, but at least
it leaves you with much more freedom and ostensibly keeps the core
idea of the whole thing. Also, the whole concept of "goto hell" was
abandoned.</p>
<p><strong>C++</strong> would be <strong>Islam</strong> - It takes
C and not only keeps all its laws, but adds a very complex new set
of laws on top of it. It's so versatile that it can be used to be
the foundation of anything, from great atrocities to beautiful
works of art. Its followers are convinced that it is the ultimate
universal language, and may be angered by those who disagree. Also,
if you insult it or its founder, you'll probably be threatened with
death by more radical followers.</p>
<p><strong>C#</strong> would be <strong>Mormonism</strong> - At
first glance, it's the same as Java, but at a closer look you
realize that it's controlled by a single corporation (which many
Java followers believe to be evil), and that many theological
concepts are quite different. You suspect that it'd probably be
nice, if only all the followers of Java wouldn't discriminate so
much against you for following it.</p>
<p><strong>Lisp</strong> would be <strong>Zen Buddhism</strong> -
There is no syntax, there is no centralization of dogma, there are
no deities to worship. The entire universe is there at your reach -
if only you are enlightened enough to grasp it. Some say that it's
not a language at all; others say that it's the only language that
makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>Haskell</strong> would be <strong>Taoism</strong> - It
is so different from other languages that many people don't
understand how can anyone use it to produce anything useful. Its
followers believe that it's the true path to wisdom, but that
wisdom is beyond the grasp of most mortals.</p>
<p><strong>Erlang</strong> would be <strong>Hinduism</strong> -
It's another strange language that doesn't look like it could be
used for anything, but unlike most other modern languages, it's
built around the concept of multiple simultaneous deities.</p>
<p><strong>Perl</strong> would be <strong>Voodoo</strong> - An
incomprehensible series of arcane incantations that involve the
blood of goats and permanently corrupt your soul. Often used when
your boss requires you to do an urgent task at 21:00 on friday
night.</p>
<p><strong>Lua</strong> would be <strong>Wicca</strong> - A
pantheistic language that can easily be adapted for different
cultures and locations. Its code is very liberal, and allows for
the use of techniques that might be described as magical by those
used to more traditional languages. It has a strong connection to
the moon.</p>
<p><strong>Ruby</strong> would be <strong>Neo-Paganism</strong> - A
mixture of different languages and ideas that was beaten together
into something that might be identified as a language. Its
adherents are growing fast, and although most people look at them
suspiciously, they are mostly well-meaning people with no intention
of harming anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Python</strong> would be <strong>Humanism</strong> -
It's simple, unrestrictive, and all you need to follow it is common
sense. Many of the followers claim to feel relieved from all the
burden imposed by other languages, and that they have rediscovered
the joy of programming. There are some who say that it is a form of
pseudo-code.</p>
<p><strong>COBOL</strong> would be <strong>Ancient
Paganism</strong> - There was once a time when it ruled over a vast
region and was important, but nowadays it's almost dead, for the
good of us all. Although many were scarred by the rituals demanded
by its deities, there are some who insist on keeping it alive even
today.</p>
<p><strong>APL</strong> would be <strong>Scientology</strong> -
There are many people who claim to follow it, but you've always
suspected that it's a huge and elaborate prank that got out of
control.</p>
<p><strong>LOLCODE</strong> would be
<strong>Pastafarianism</strong> - An esoteric, Internet-born belief
that nobody really takes seriously, despite all the efforts to
develop and spread it.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Basic</strong> would be <strong>Satanism</strong>
- Except that you don't REALLY need to sell your soul to be a
Satanist...</p>

He reduces height and spots a man down below. He lowers the balloon

<p>The man below says: <em>"Yes. You're in a hot air balloon,
hovering 30 feet above this field."</em></p>
<p><em>"You must work in Information Technology,"</em> says the
balloonist.</p>
<p><em>"I do"</em> replies the man. <em>"How did you
know?"</em></p>
<p><em>"Well"</em>, says the balloonist, <em>"everything you have
told me is technically correct, but It's of no use to
anyone."</em></p>
<p>The man below replies, <em>"You must work in
management."</em></p>
<p><em>"I do"</em>, replies the balloonist, <em>"But how'd you
know?"</em></p>
<p><em>"Well"</em>, says the man, <em>"you don't know where you are
or where you're going, but you expect me to be able to help.

<p>A young Programmer and his Project Manager board a train headed
through the mountains on its way to Wichita. They can find no place
to sit except for two seats right across the aisle from a young
woman and her grandmother. After a while, it is obvious that the
young woman and the young programmer are interested in each other,
because they are giving each other looks. Soon the train passes
into a tunnel and it is pitch black. There is a sound of a kiss
followed by the sound of a slap.</p>
<p>When the train emerges from the tunnel, the four sit there
without saying a word. The grandmother is thinking to herself, "It
was very brash for that young man to kiss my granddaughter, but I'm
glad she slapped him."</p>
<p>The Project manager is sitting there thinking, "I didn't know
the young tech was brave enough to kiss the girl, but I sure wish
she hadn't missed him when she slapped me!"</p>
<p>The young woman was sitting and thinking, "I'm glad the guy
kissed me, but I wish my grandmother had not slapped him!"</p>
<p>The young programmer sat there with a satisfied smile on his
face. He thought to himself, "Life is good. How often does a guy
have the chance to kiss a beautiful girl and slap his Project
manager all at the same time!"</p>

<p>A physicist, an engineer and a programmer were in a car driving
over a steep alpine pass when the brakes failed. The car was
getting faster and faster, they were struggling to get round the
corners and once or twice only the feeble crash barrier saved them
from crashing down the side of the mountain. They were sure they
were all going to die, when suddenly they spotted an escape lane.
They pulled into the escape lane, and came safely to a halt.</p>
<p>The physicist said "We need to model the friction in the brake
pads and the resultant temperature rise, see if we can work out why
they failed".</p>
<p>The engineer said "I think I've got a few spanners in the back.
I'll take a look and see if I can work out what's wrong".</p>
<p>The programmer said "Why don't we get going again and see if
it's reproducible?"</p>

four major species of Unix sysadmins:</h1>
<p><strong>TECHNICAL THUG:</strong> Usually a systems programmer
who has been forced into system administration; writes scripts in a

<p><strong>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST:</strong> Usually a retentive
drone (or rarely, a harridan ex-secretary) who has been forced into
system administration.</p>
<p><strong>MANIAC:</strong> Usually an aging cracker who discovered
that neither the Mossad nor Cuba are willing to pay a living wage
for computer espionage. Fell into system administration;
occasionally approaches major competitors with indesp schemes.</p>

<h1 id="situations">Situations</h1>
<h2 id="low-disk-space">Low Disk Space</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>TECHNICAL THUG:</strong> Writes a suite of scripts to
monitor disk usage, maintain a database of historic disk usage,
predict future disk usage via least squares regression analysis,
identify users who are more than a standard deviation over the
mean, and send mail to the offending parties. Places script in
cron. Disk usage does not change, since disk-hogs, by nature,
either ignore script-generated mail, or file it away in
triplicate.</p>
<p><strong>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST:</strong> Puts disk usage policy
in motd. Uses disk quotas. Allows no exceptions, thus crippling

<blockquote>
<p><strong>TECHNICAL THUG:</strong> Writes a suite of scripts to
monitor processes, maintain a database of CPU usage, identify
processes more than a standard deviation over the norm, and renice
offending processes. Places script in cron. Ends up renicing the
production database into oblivion, bringing operations to a
grinding halt, much to the delight of the xtrek freaks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>TECHNICAL THUG:</strong> Writes perl script that creates
home directory, copies in incomprehensible default environment, and
places entries in /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, and /etc/group. (By
hand, NOT with passmgmt.) Slaps on setuid bit; tells a nearby
secretary to handle new accounts. Usually, said secretary is still
dithering over the difference between 'enter' and 'return'; and so,
no new accounts are ever created.</p>
<p><strong>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST:</strong> Puts new account policy
in motd. Since people without accounts cannot read the motd, nobody
ever fulfills the bureaucratic requirements; and so, no new
accounts are ever created.</p>
<p><strong>MANIAC:</strong> "If you're too stupid to break in and

<p><strong>TECHNICAL THUG:</strong> Repairs drive. Usually is able
to repair filesystem from boot monitor. Failing that, front-panel
toggles microkernel in and starts script on neighboring machine to
load binary boot code into broken machine, reformat and reinstall
OS. Lets it run over the weekend while he goes mountain
climbing.</p>
<p><strong>ADMINISTRATIVE FASCIST:</strong> Begins investigation to
determine who broke the drive. Refuses to fix system until culprit
is identified and charged for the equipment.</p>
<p><strong>MANIAC, LARGE SYSTEM:</strong> Rips drive from system,
uses sledgehammer to smash same to flinders. Calls manufacturer,
threatens pets. Abuses field engineer while they put in a new drive
and reinstall the OS.</p>
<p><strong>MANIAC, SMALL SYSTEM:</strong> Rips drive from system,
uses ball-peen hammer to smash same to flinders. Calls

<p><em>MANIAC:</em>* Screams at users until they go away. Sometimes
barters knowledge for powerful drink and/or sycophantic

<p><em>Demonstration syndrome(DS):</em> It goes wrong only when you
show it to someone else. The severity of the failure is directly
proportional to the importance of the people watching the
demonstration. See Also: Professor negation field.</p>
<p><em>Reverse demonstration syndrome(Reverse DS):</em> When you
try to make it go wrong deliberately, no matter how hard you try,
it doesn't. The severity of the syndrome is directly proportional
to the technical competence of the people watching.</p>
<p><em>Demonstration syndrome competition:</em> Occurs when you try
to demonstrate something going wrong. The two syndrome compete,
resulting in perfectly unpredictable behaviour. In particular sever
cases of DSC will actually cause something completely separate to
the object of the demonstration to go wrong, often spectacularly.
The severity of the failure is directly proportional to both the
importance and competence of the people watching.</p>

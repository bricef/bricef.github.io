# Thank you for the torn pages, Mum

Thank you for not letting me get away with shoddy work. 

Thank you for holding me up to a high standard

Thank you for tearing the pages of my excercise book when my work wasn't good enough. 

I've left my ego at the door. I'm happy to throw my work away. 

I'm happy to be told my work's not good enough. It just means that I get to be better.

Thankyou for never attacking me, but only criticising my work. Thankyou for saying "I love you, but this isn't good enough". You never brought down my ego, only raised my standards.

It's not the ones that ride you hard that you should be worried about, it's the people who don't care either way you should get away from.

It's why I'm an entrepreneur. Because you cared, and now I care too, and I set the bar. I get to produce the work I know I'm capable of. 

Mum, thank you for teaching me self respect.

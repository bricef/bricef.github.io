# Topics of studies for programmers

## Breadth first versus depth first learning
+ Pros of depth first
    * employable
    * fun
    * Total creds
    * Focused
    * Learn the idioms
+ Cons of depth first

    * Go through a skill inventory
    * What do you understand least?
        - What would most make you sweat if an interviewer asked you?
    * Excercises for finding your comfort zone
        - Interview club
        - conferences
        - Blogs
        - Acronym
        - in common: exposure to many concepts
        - See my [ten ways to discover gaps in your knowledge]()
+ How?
    * Move up an abstraction layer
    * Move down an abstraction layer
    * Move into infrastructure
        - network architecture
    * figure out how a tool you use work
        - VM?
            + Memory management
            + Garbage Collection
        - OS concepts?
        - Network?
    * What are the idioms of the tools you use?
    * Go out of programming to achieve perspective
        - Psychology (the psychology of computer programmings)
        - Becoming a technical leader
        - The black art of Estimation
        - what's all this management stuff anyway?
    * The mouse click exercise
        - What's the stack
        - A full description could take several **Days** how much can you give?
+ Competition is healthy
    * Competitive programming exercises
    * Programmer's competition
    * xtreme startup
    * codewars
    * Real competition is called the market - dare you play?
+ Play with others
    * You can't stretch on your own. Other people are neccessary to reach your maximum potential.
    * Team exercises
    * Codementors, AirPair

- Go Meta
    + Learn about learning
    + Learn about problem solving
    + Learn about complexity
    + Learn about 

- Break things
    + Pen testing and exploit writing
    + The knowledge is in the gaps and dark corners
    + the art of exploitation
    + Pick an exploit. Write the code. Make it work
    + fertile groung for learning


- Tips to make it work 
    + Base on project with a goal
    + Concentrate on discovering new ways of thinking
    + Remember that while I hate to quote the Matrix "there is a difference between knowing the path and knowing the path - Morpheus"
    + Learn to teach
        * blogs
        * book?
        * conferences
        * workshops


# Project and topic ideas
That you might not be familiar with

Stuff in groups
- great group projects 
    + let everyone contribute
        * EG nand2tetris where different people's expertise shone through differently at different chapters
- Pick a user story
    + use different technologies to solve the same problem
    + Bonus points for a real one
    + Bonus points if you're pro bono working on it so the time has value to someone else
- Topics you might have forgotten
    - Crypto Engineering
        + Zero knowledge proofs
        + How does Bitcoin really work? Are you sure? prove it.
    - System integration
        + Katas are nice, but the real world is plugging APIs together. should we train that?
    - Architecture matters
        + Are you honing your skills?
        + How do you do it?
        + Architecture katas?
        + Testing architecture
    - Computer Graphics and rendering
        + Implement your own renderer using textbooks
        + Lighting algos?
        + fundamentals of computer graphics

Essential Programming Skills Not Taught In School
=================================================

Or, what I wish I had learnt before my first job
------------------------------------------------

I recently came across a [Quora question](http://www.quora.com/Computer-Science-Education/What-technical-skill-s-are-essential-to-a-programming-career-but-are-often-not-covered-in-undergraduate-computer-science-courses):

> What technical skill(s) are essential to a programming career but are often not covered in undergraduate computer science courses?

And wanted to add my own perspective as someone whose background isn't computer science. 

Since I will also soon be quitting my current job, it's a great opportuniity to review the things I have learnt in the last two years or so.

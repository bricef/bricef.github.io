# About this page
I keep track of my public commitments on this page. You can see the progress of each commitment below. 

The data is tracked using [Beeminder](http://beeminder.com), an awesome service that keeps track of your goals. If I fail to live up to my commitment, beeminder charges me money. Everytime I fail to meet the commitment, the amount Beeminder charges me goes up. 

<span style="font-weight:bold;color:green">Green</span> means that I have plenty of safety margin and am meeting my commitment.

<span style="font-weight:bold;color:blue">Blue</span> means I am on track but without much safety margin. Basically, I'm meeting my commitments.

<span style="font-weight:bold;color:orange">Orange</span> means that I am currently slipping and am at risk of derailing and failing to meet my commitment. If you care to, you can send me an email at [brice@fractallambda.com](mailto:brice@fractallambda.com?subject=You%20Are%20Off%20The%20Road!) to nudge me back on the road.

<span style="font-weight:bold;color:red">Red</span> means that I have missed my commitment or am within 24 hours of doing so. If the last item on the path is a red arrow, I have until the end of the day to correct course. Ff the last item is a red circle, I have missed my commitment.

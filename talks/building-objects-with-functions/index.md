# Building objects with functions
In this talk, I build a simple object system using some simple functions. It was inspired by reading Chapter 25 of [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/)'s [On Lisp](http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html). You can find [the full text available for free](http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisptext.html) on his website.

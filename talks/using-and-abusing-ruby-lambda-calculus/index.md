# Using and abusing Ruby for computer science great good

This talks uses ruby to illustrate [Church Encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding) in the [Lambda Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus). It uses [Ruby's Proc](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.0.0/Proc.html) as a substitute for lambda expressions. It is suitable for an audience without a computer science background, but some programming experience is needed to follow along. This talk is heavily indebted to Chapter 6 of [Tom Stuart](http://codon.com/)'s excellent [Understanding Computation book](http://computationbook.com/).

You can find [a recording and transcript of the first workshop](https://pusher.com/sessions/meetup/sheffield-ruby-user-group/using-and-abusing-ruby-for-computer-science-great-good) courtesy of [Pusher's Sessions](https://pusher.com/sessions/). Do note that the first workshop suffered from a couple of flaws â€“ notably a poor explanation of the church encoding of lists.

This talk was originally given at the [Sheffield Ruby User Group](https://shrug.org/) as a [workshop](https://www.meetup.com/sheffieldrubyists/events/237911522/). It was also delivered to the [Cambridge Programmers' Study Group](https://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-Programmers-Study-Group/) as a [talk](https://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-Programmers-Study-Group/events/238246081/).
